# Prolog-Mazes

## The Prolog Project
The Jupyter Notebook "Mazes Creation Script" allows us to convert images of labyrinths into rules 
and draw the path that would be followed to solve the labyrinth.

The prolog file "MazeSolver.pl" is the skeleton on which we have worked to solve mazes

In the folder of "mazes" there are several images of labyrinths that, through the Jupyter Notebook 
we have translated to rules.

In the folder "facts" there are the text files with the facts (entry point to the labyrinth, exit and the 
existing walls) that prolog can understand. The prolog file that we have programmed can read files so we just 
have to indicate the path of the file we want to solve.

In the folder "solutions" there are text files with the path that should be followed to solve the labyrinth, 
along with an image of the path

## Why this project? Time to tell a story...
Well, We both are finishing the master degree in Artificial Inteligent in the "Universidad Politecnica de Madrid" 
[MUIA](http://www.dia.fi.upm.es/masteria/?q=es/MUIA) and we have a Prolog subject. We have been asked to do a 
project in which we use prolog to solve a problem based on rules and we both think about using prolog to 
solve mazes, defining the labyrinths in images, translating them into a matrix and then rules that prolog 
could understand and finally, use prolog to solve the path that must be followed to solve the labyrinths.

If you read any bad translation in documentation or code send us an email with the sentence that is 
poorly written together with a more accurate sentence (^.^)

Thanks for read me!
